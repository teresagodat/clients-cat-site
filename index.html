    <h2>The Kitties To Go story</h2>
      <p>
          Not everyone can own a cat, but now, everyone can at least have one for a day! I love cats, but there was a time when the place I lived did not allow me to have a pet there. This was sad. It got me thinking that there are a lot of folks that may be in the same predicament and need to have some kitty snuggles and purrs from time to time. You no longer have to be deprived. Go ahead, rent one, two, or more for the day and become happy again!
      </p>

          <q>I don't know what I would do without Kitties to Go. I am allergic to cats and cannot own one, but every once in awhile I'll dose up on allergy meds and rent a cat for a day. This makes me happy. </q> - Beth
